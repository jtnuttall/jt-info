<h1>About
<h2>About me
<p>I'm James Thomas â€” born Jeremy Taylor Nuttall. This is my personal site 
    for writing and self-promotion. I'm a graduate of USC with a computer 
    science degree and a knack for writing and speaking.

<p>Please see my <a href="@{ResumeR}">resume</a>!

<h2>About the site
<p>This site was written and scaffolded in Yesod, a Haskell web framework! 
    Prospective employers are welcome to request the source for the website,
    which I maintain in a private git repository.

<p>In future, I will expand a bit on the project's architecture and internal 
    workings. Yesod has facilitated relatively small amounts of code. Every 
    page is written in one of its templating languages, permittinng quick 
    and lightweight development.
